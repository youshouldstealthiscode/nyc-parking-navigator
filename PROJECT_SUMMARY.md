## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Parking Overlay**
- Color-coded street segments (green=available, red=restricted, blue=metered)
- Updates based on current time and parking rules
- Follows user location with GPS tracking

### 2. **Smart Rule Parser**
- Parses complex NYC parking signs
- Handles time ranges, day restrictions, and special rules
- Examples: "NO PARKING 8AM-6PM MON THRU FRI", "2 HOUR PARKING EXCEPT SUNDAY"

### 3. **Android Navigation App**
- Google Maps integration with custom overlays
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Voice announcements for parking availability
- Automatic updates as you drive

### 4. **Data Integration**
- OpenCurb API for Midtown Manhattan (real-time data)
- NYC Open Data for city-wide parking signs
- PostGIS database for spatial queries
- Daily data updates

### 5. **Web Dashboard**
- Interactive map for testing
- Time-based parking queries
- Click anywhere to check parking
- Visual parking status indicators
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (Automated)
```bash
cd /Users/joesmbp/Projects/nyc-parking-navigator
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Start the backend API server
- Launch the web dashboard
- Display all running services

### Manual Start
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Dashboard (in new terminal)
cd web-dashboard
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd backend
python test_api.py
```

Run the interactive demo:
```bash
python demo.py
```

## 📍 Current Coverage

- **OpenCurb**: Midtown Manhattan (30th-59th St)
- **NYC Open Data**: All 5 boroughs (with setup)

## 🔑 Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/PostGIS
- **Android**: Kotlin, Google Maps, Retrofit
- **Web**: JavaScript, Leaflet, HTML5
- **Data**: GeoJSON, NYC Open Data API
## 📱 Android App Features

The Android app includes:
- Real-time map overlay following the user
- Color-coded parking segments
- Voice announcements: "Parking available on 42nd Street, east side"
- Battery-optimized GPS tracking
- Offline mode support

## 🌟 Unique Features

1. **Time-based predictions**: See when parking will become available
2. **Voice navigation**: Audio alerts while driving
3. **F/LOSS**: Completely open source
4. **Modular design**: Easy to extend and customize
5. **Real-time updates**: Live parking rule calculations

## 📊 API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /parking/query` - Query parking by location/time
- `GET /parking/location/{lat}/{lon}` - Simple location query
- `GET /parking/rules/parse` - Test rule parser
- Full docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

## 🚧 Next Steps

1. **Expand Coverage**:
   - Import full NYC Open Data dataset
   - Add more OpenCurb coverage areas
   - Integrate garage availability APIs

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Parking spot predictions
   - Route optimization for parking
   - Community reporting system
   - Historical parking patterns

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy backend to cloud (AWS/GCP)
   - Publish Android app to Play Store
   - Set up monitoring and analytics

4. **Community Features**:
   - User reports for temporary restrictions
   - Favorite parking spots
   - Share parking locations with friends
