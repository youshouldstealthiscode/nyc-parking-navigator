# Gradle Wrapper JAR
This file would normally contain the gradle-wrapper.jar binary.
For the APK build to work, you'll need to:

1. Download gradle-wrapper.jar from:
   https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
   
2. Place it in this directory (android/gradle/wrapper/)

Or run this command from the android directory:
```
gradle wrapper
```

The wrapper is required for the build process.
